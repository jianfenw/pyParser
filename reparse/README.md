# Reparse
Regular expression is used to extracting data from natural languages. If you need scan/search/parse/transform some unstructured input and get some semi-structured data out of it Reparse might be able to help.</br>
`Reparse` is a quite simple and useful in certain scenarios. This library just gives you a way to combine regular expression together and hook them up to some callback functions in Python. You have to define functions in Python, but expressions and patterns can be defined in Yami, JSON or Python.</br>


# How to use 'Reparse'
Create seperate files in yaml or json format to describe the expressions and patterns for regular expression matching.</br>
Then, write the callback functions corresponding to different conditions. Include and use these functions to achieve your own goal.
